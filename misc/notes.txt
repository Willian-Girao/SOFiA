hypothesis was fundamental to the developnmt of particle swarm optimization" - PSO

"One motive for developing the simdation was to model human social behavior, which is of course not
identical to fish schooling or bird flocking. Che important difference is its abstractness. Birds and fish
adjust their physical movement to avoid prechtors, seek food and mates, optimize environmental
parameters such as temperature, etc. Humans; adjust not only physical movement but cognitive or
experiential variables as well. We do not usually walk in step and tum in unison (though some
fascinating research in human conformity shows that we are capable of it); rather, we tend to adjust our
beliefs and attitudes to conform with those cd our social peers." - PSO
